#### Detailed Issues:




## Next Steps


1. **Fix critical issues** - Address TypeScript errors first
2. **Run build again** - Test after each fix
3. **Enable gradual strictness** - Fix issues incrementally
4. **Update team workflow** - Ensure everyone runs pre-commit checks

### Recommended Fix Order:
1. TypeScript errors (prevent runtime issues)
2. ESLint errors (code quality and consistency)
3. Build configuration issues (deployment problems)


## Configuration Changes Made

- ✅ Updated Next.js config for strict builds
- ✅ Created pre-commit hook for quality gates
- ✅ Backup files created for rollback if needed

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, restore configurations:
```bash
cp next.config.mjs.backup next.config.mjs
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit  
```
